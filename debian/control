Description: detect abusive usage levels on high traffic nameservers
 This package provides the dns-flood-detector daemon.
 .
 It was developed to detect abusive usage levels on high traffic nameservers
 and to enable quick response in halting the use of one's nameserver to
 facilitate spam.
 It uses libpcap (in non-promiscuous mode) to monitor incoming dns queries to a
 nameserver. The tool may be run in one of two modes, either daemon mode or
 "bindsnap" mode. In daemon mode, the tool will alarm via syslog. In bindsnap
 mode, the user is able to get near-real-time stats on usage to aid in more
 detailed troubleshooting.
